This software consists of two parts, a DataHistorian (DH) and a web-based user interface (unidb).
A DataHistorian, also called a TimeSeries Database, collects metric data for a defined point and stores it in a database with a timestamp. Each data set therefore consists of a unique identifier for the data point, a timestamp and a metric value.
The second part, the unidb, is a web-based user interface for the DH. It also contains modules for generating forms & reports and a graphical SQL editor. This allows you to create complete applications that use Mariadb or Mysql as a database.

To install the application, please start the **install** programm as root.
